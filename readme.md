# Linear Programming Model

This can be used to determine maximal profits under specified conditions.
1. Item 1 can be produced in A time at B cost and sold for C revenue
2. Item 2 can be produced in D time at E cost and sold for F revenue
3. A maximum cost is imposed
4. A time limit is imposed

### Example:

```
A woodworker can 
- make a table in 2 hours at the cost of $15 and selling for a revenue of $90
- make a chair in 5 hours at the cost of $45 and selling for a revenue of $180

The woodworker would like to limit costs to $315 per workweek, working 40 hours in a given week.

What is the maximum profit the woodworker can achieve? What quantities of each would they produce in that given week.
```
